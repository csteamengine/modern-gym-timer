# modern-gym-timer
## Overview
This project is my attempt at making a DIY pocket-sized gym timer, similar to the Timebirds one. I love their product and think it is actually very reasonably priced, but I want to try to make my own. 

## Setup
### Install Arduino Libraries

* Adafruit GFX
* Adafruit BusIO
